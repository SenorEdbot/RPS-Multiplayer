# RPS-Multiplayer

This is the multiplayer rock paper scissors game.

In its current state either user can select either list item and have that data moved to the database.
When there are 2 guesses in the database the game runs the logic to determine if player 1 or player 2 won. 

Neither play can see the other players guess but I was not able to isolate the 'currentUser' and compare them to user1 & user2 in my database. 

It took me forever but I was finally able to set user1 and user2 in the database with an unique id I was able to reference. I feel I was super close to being able to limit who chooses what guess. 
Using the same logic to determine who was player 1 and who was player 2 I would have been able to add a chat function much easier. 

The wins and losses automatically update when those field are changed in the database like the game should. 

I want to try and come back to this, if not try and complete by Tuesday this week. -I'm pretty bummed I ran out of time I was so close.
